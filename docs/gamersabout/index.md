title: About The Gamers Network
---
The Gamers Network is an organization that make awesome games to Minecraft.
---
It's founded last year, by [morpig](https://github.com/morpig). The 1st time, The Gamers Network was a SMP server, which
allows my friend to play on my server. After learning some things, he decided to make a brand new server.
After couple of months work, we are bringing you around 6 games on the server.

We're hosted on [IndonesianCloud](http://indonesiancloud.com) to host our server, which is awesome for asia region!
We use [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) and [Maven](http://apache.maven.oeg) to build our Java projects.

What we do is private, not open-sourced. Some of our repository are open source, which you can check it out.
