# Information about `map.yml`
The `map.yml` is the Map API you coded for your map. The file is very important when it comes to having your
map loaded and tested.

Also, take note of the code guidelines when creating your `map.yml` file:
      - *Verify there are no tabs* in the *YML* - 4 spaces
      - Change the map version if there's a gameplay change or map change
      - Check again that your YML file is correct.

# Compiling your folder to ZIP
Before you upload your map, compress the folder to a `.zip` format. We dont accept `.rar` format.
To compress your folder:
    - `Windows` Right-click folder -> Send to -> Compressed Zip

# Uploading your worrld
