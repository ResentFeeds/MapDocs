## [About The Gamers Network](/gamersabout)

## What do Map API do?
Our configuration, which morpig called as the 'Map API' configure how that game manages that game during game-play or in-game.
All The Gamers Network map requires Map API to function properly. Map API defines a lot of aspects such as spawn points, teams, chest config and more. Each file is unique (some of them are the same) to it's map.

## Writing the Map API
Almost all text editor (maybe except Notepad) can create and edit Map API files which is YAML.

We recommend that you use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io) to create and edit Map API files.

We HIGHLY recommended to keep the Map API clean & readable. You should properly indent them using 4 spaces and specify the API you intend to use.

## Releasing your Map
Before releasing your map for our developers which is [CubedRams](http://twitter.com/TheRamsnet) and [PsychothekidLMC](https://github.com/Psychothekid), we HIGHLY recommended to follow [these guidelines](packaging/package_guideline). This will speed up some time to take it faster for your map to be ready for testing.
